<h2><i>Mermaid on the Moon</i> </h2>
<h3>Character design</h3>
<p>Mermaid On The Moon is an English comic that I have been working on since May 2021.This is a story about a mermaid, Mary and a girl from the moon, Lily.<br>
<br>
---<br>
    One day, Mary found an unfamiliar rock in the ocean; therefore, she went to the outside to figure out where the rock was coming from. When she came the outside, she found a rocket landing by the sea. While she was wondering what the rocket was, a girl, Lily appeared from behind it. Lily said she came from the moon and visited the earth to find a lunar rock that she lost. Mary realized the rock that she found in the ocean must be Lily's; therefore, Mary handed the rock back to Lily. Lily was glad that she found the rock, but she noticed that her rocket was broken and she couldn't go back to her home for a while. Mary decided to help her out and became a friend of her.<br>

    My rule for creating characters is to make them simple; therefore, I can easily familiarize with my characters. I did not make characters in this comic complex. For example, Mary (a mermaid)'s hair is blonde because the idea came from the color of the moon. The art style of this comic is Anime style (Japanese cartoon style) since I am Japanese and more familiar to the style.</p>
